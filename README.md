# Skyblock-AFK

This project implements the code from the plugin [GSit](https://github.com/Gecolay/GSit) which is not my property nor my content, I had to implement it to do cool features with scoreboard outlines to players and fix issues where it would glitch out those outlines when un-mounting from locations.

Everything else is my code and is under the MIT license.
